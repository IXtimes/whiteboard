# whiteboard
A simple, semi-lightweight whiteboard application designed to create a simple whiteboard-like experience on your desktop. This project is a simple Tkinter project that creates a simple, yet elegant whiteboard experience with a small, but powerful pallet, size controls, and draw software features that overall is an enhanced whiteboard experience. With quick imports and exports of images onto the whiteboard, this application excels at being a simple app for assignments where you need to show written work. Boot up the app, write your work as you solve a problem, and then export it when you are done. With additional undo/redo functionality, simple mistakes or possible tangents can be fixed in no time at all!

KEYBIND SHORTCUTS:
- Draw - Left Mouse Button
- Erase - Right Mouse Button
- Color Pick - Tab
- Quick Adjust Brush Size - Scrollwheel
- Quick Save - Ctrl + S
- Quick Open - Ctrl + O
- Undo - Ctrl + Z
- Redo - Ctrl + Shift + Z

The tool panel for the application sits in a separate window to allow for seamless streaming of the canvas space without over-encumbering it with the tools needed to work with the whiteboard. Hope you enjoy this simple, yet malleable whiteboard for your desktop :)
